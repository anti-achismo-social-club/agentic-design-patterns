# Appendix B: AI Agentic - From GUI to Real World Environment

**Pages: 6**
**Author: Antonio Gulli**

## Brief Description

This appendix explores the critical transition from graphical user interface (GUI) interactions to real-world environment deployment for AI agents. It covers the challenges, strategies, and best practices for moving agentic systems from controlled interfaces to complex, dynamic real-world scenarios.
