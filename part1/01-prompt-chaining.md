# Chapter 1: Prompt Chaining

*Original content: 12 pages - by Antonio Gulli*

## Brief Description

Prompt chaining is a fundamental agentic design pattern where the output of one prompt becomes the input to the next prompt in a sequence. This pattern enables the breakdown of complex tasks into manageable, sequential steps, allowing for more controlled and interpretable AI system behavior.

## Introduction

Prompt chaining represents one of the most accessible and powerful patterns in agentic AI system design. By connecting multiple prompts in a sequential manner, developers can create sophisticated workflows that handle complex reasoning tasks while maintaining transparency and control over each step of the process.

This pattern is particularly valuable when dealing with multi-step problems that require different types of reasoning or processing at each stage. Rather than attempting to solve everything in a single, complex prompt, prompt chaining allows for modular problem-solving approaches.

## Key Concepts

### Sequential Processing
- Each prompt in the chain performs a specific, well-defined task
- The output of one prompt serves as input to the next
- Clear handoff points between prompts ensure data integrity

### Task Decomposition
- Complex problems are broken down into smaller, manageable components
- Each component can be optimized independently
- Easier debugging and maintenance of the overall system

### State Management
- Information flows through the chain in a controlled manner
- Intermediate results can be stored, logged, or modified
- Error handling can be implemented at each step

### Modularity
- Individual prompts can be reused across different chains
- Components can be updated or replaced without affecting the entire system
- Testing and validation can be performed at the component level

## Implementation

### Basic Chain Structure
```python
def prompt_chain(initial_input):
    # Step 1: Analysis
    analysis = call_llm(analysis_prompt, initial_input)

    # Step 2: Planning
    plan = call_llm(planning_prompt, analysis)

    # Step 3: Execution
    result = call_llm(execution_prompt, plan)

    return result
```

### Advanced Chain Management
- Implement error handling and retry logic
- Add logging and monitoring at each step
- Include conditional branching based on intermediate results
- Store intermediate states for debugging and analysis

## Code Examples

### Example 1: Document Analysis Chain
```python
class DocumentAnalysisChain:
    def __init__(self):
        self.summarizer_prompt = "Summarize the following document: {document}"
        self.extractor_prompt = "Extract key entities from: {summary}"
        self.classifier_prompt = "Classify the document type based on: {entities}"

    def analyze(self, document):
        # Step 1: Summarize
        summary = self.llm_call(self.summarizer_prompt, document=document)

        # Step 2: Extract entities
        entities = self.llm_call(self.extractor_prompt, summary=summary)

        # Step 3: Classify
        classification = self.llm_call(self.classifier_prompt, entities=entities)

        return {
            'summary': summary,
            'entities': entities,
            'classification': classification
        }
```

### Example 2: Creative Writing Chain
```python
def creative_writing_chain(topic, style):
    # Generate outline
    outline_prompt = f"Create an outline for a {style} story about {topic}"
    outline = generate_response(outline_prompt)

    # Develop characters
    character_prompt = f"Based on this outline: {outline}, create detailed characters"
    characters = generate_response(character_prompt)

    # Write story
    story_prompt = f"Write a {style} story using outline: {outline} and characters: {characters}"
    story = generate_response(story_prompt)

    return story
```

## Best Practices

### Design Principles
- **Single Responsibility**: Each prompt should have one clear purpose
- **Clear Interfaces**: Define explicit input/output formats between prompts
- **Error Boundaries**: Implement proper error handling at each step
- **Logging**: Maintain comprehensive logs of the chain execution

### Optimization Strategies
- **Prompt Engineering**: Optimize each prompt individually for its specific task
- **Caching**: Cache intermediate results where appropriate
- **Parallel Execution**: Identify opportunities for parallel processing
- **Resource Management**: Monitor token usage and API costs

### Testing and Validation
- Test each prompt in isolation before integration
- Create comprehensive test suites for the entire chain
- Monitor chain performance and accuracy over time
- Implement A/B testing for prompt variations

## Common Pitfalls

### Information Loss
- **Problem**: Important context gets lost between chain steps
- **Solution**: Implement proper state management and context preservation
- **Mitigation**: Include relevant context in each prompt

### Chain Brittleness
- **Problem**: Failure in one step breaks the entire chain
- **Solution**: Implement robust error handling and fallback mechanisms
- **Mitigation**: Design redundant pathways for critical operations

### Over-Engineering
- **Problem**: Creating unnecessarily complex chains for simple tasks
- **Solution**: Start simple and add complexity only when needed
- **Mitigation**: Regular review and simplification of chain logic

### Cost Accumulation
- **Problem**: Multiple API calls can become expensive
- **Solution**: Optimize prompt efficiency and implement caching
- **Mitigation**: Monitor costs and implement usage limits

### Context Window Limitations
- **Problem**: Accumulated context exceeds model limits
- **Solution**: Implement context pruning and summarization strategies
- **Mitigation**: Design chains with context window constraints in mind

## Conclusion

Prompt chaining provides a robust foundation for building sophisticated agentic AI systems. By breaking complex tasks into manageable sequential steps, this pattern enables developers to create more reliable, maintainable, and interpretable AI workflows. Success with prompt chaining requires careful attention to design principles, proper error handling, and continuous optimization of individual chain components.
